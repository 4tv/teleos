## Addressing Security Concerns

We assign the utmost importance to all reports related to security.

Upon receiving these reports, we undertake a thorough investigation and take swift action to rectify any identified weaknesses as promptly as we can. If you come across a potential security problem within this project, we encourage you to get in touch with us by sending an [email](mailto:security@teleos.io). We kindly request you to refrain from disclosing these issues publicly on this project's GitHub page.
